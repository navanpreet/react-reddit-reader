There is minimal UI work as the assignment focuses on features and correctness. It took me a little over than 3 hours to finish this.

Although I have extensive experience with Angular, I chose to do this assignment in React as I've been looking into it recently. I have used stateless and stateful components wherever needed.

Features of the app:

1. A global redux store is used that persists state in local storage so that the app retains subreddits even if the app is reset.
2. A user can subscribe/unsubscribe to a subreddit either on all subreddits page or that specific subreddit page.
3. A user can search for a subreddit.
4. Paging is implemented.
